   chapter i  the unpresentable appearance of colonel crane these stories tell about things recognized as impossible to do  if the writer just said that they happened  without saying how they happened  nobody would believe him  just like no one believes the story about the cow who jumped over the moon  the first story begins on a straight road of bright houses in a suburb of a big city  the time was about twenty minutes to eleven on sunday morning  when a procession of suburban families in sunday clothes were going up the road to church  and the man was a very respectable retired military man named colonel crane  who was also going to church  as he had done every sunday at the same hour for many years  he was dressed very elegantly for church as if for parade  but his clothes did not stand out in any way  he was quite handsome in a dry  sun baked style  but his blond hair was of a colourless sort  and though his blue eyes were clear  they looked out a little heavily under lowered eyelids  colonel crane belonged to the previous age in the history of england  he was not really old  indeed he was hardly middle aged  and had received his last medals for the great war     great war                                                                                                                                                    but for a number of reasons he still belonged to the traditional type of the old professional soldiers  the way it had existed before       each church in those times had only one colonel as it had only one priest  it would be quite unjust to call him an old ruin  indeed  it would be much better to call him a bastion  because he had remained in the traditions as firmly and patiently as he had stood under enemy fire  he was simply a man who had no taste for changing his habits  and had never worried about conventions enough to change them  one of his excellent habits was to go to church at eleven o   clock  so he went there every sunday  and he did not know that there went with him something from an old world atmosphere and a paragraph in the history of england  when he came out of his front door on that particular morning  he was twisting a piece of paper in his fingers and frowning  instead of walking straight to his garden gate he walked once or twice up and down his front garden  swinging his black walking stick  the note had been given to him at breakfast  and it clearly described some practical problem which he needed to solve immediately  he stood for a few minutes looking at a red flower on of the nearest flower bed  and then a new expression came to his bronzed face  folding up the paper and putting it into his pocket  he walked round the house to the back garden  behind the back garden there was a kitchen garden  in which an old servant named archer was working as a gardener  archer was also a bastion  indeed  the two had stood together through a number of things that had killed many other good people  but though they had gone through the war together and had a complete confidence in each other  archer could never lose the manners of a servant  he performed the duties of a gardener as if he were a butler  he really performed the duties very well and enjoyed them very much  perhaps he enjoyed them so much because he was a clever cockney     cockney                                                                                                                                          and for him the country crafts were a new hobby  but somehow  whenever he said     i have put in the seeds  sir     it always sounded like     i have put the drinks on the table  sir     and he could not say    should i pull out the carrots     without seeming to say     would you like some red wine     i hope youre not working on sunday  said the colonel  with a much more pleasant smile than most people got from him  though he was always polite to everybody     you   re getting too fond of this agricultural hobby  you   ve become an uncultured peasant        i was preparing to examine the cabbages  sir     replied the uncultured peasant  in a very polite intonation     their condition yesterday evening did not look satisfactory to me        glad you didn   t spend the whole night near them     answered the colonel     but it   s lucky you   re interested in cabbages  i want to talk to you about cabbages        about cabbages  sir     asked the other respectfully  but the colonel did not answer this question  he was suddenly looking in an abstracted way at another object in the vegetable plots in front of him  we will never understand how a man   s soul and social type always affect his surroundings  anyhow  the soul of mr  archer affected the kitchen garden  it made his kitchen garden different from any other  mr  archer was after all a practical man  and he liked his new profession much more than we would think  so the kitchen garden did not look like somebody   s backyard  it really looked like a corner of a farm in the country  all sorts of practical devices were used there to protect the vegetables and berries from birds  strawberries were covered with nets  strings with feathers were stretched across the plots  and in the middle of the biggest plot stood an old and authentic scarecrow  perhaps the only one who could compete with the scarecrow for the crown of the kitchen garden was the shapeless south sea idol  which marked the border of the garden   s territory  colonel crane would not have been such a typical officer of the old army  if he had not hidden somewhere a hobby connected with his travels  his hobby was folklore of the oceanic islands and he had a souvenir from there in his garden  at the moment  however  he was not looking at the idol  he was looking at the scarecrow     by the way  archer     he said     don   t you think the scarecrow needs a new hat        i think it is hardly necessary  sir     said the gardener gravely     but look here     said the colonel     you should consider the philosophy of scarecrows  in theory  that thing is supposed to convince some rather simple minded bird that i am walking in my garden  that thing with a terrible hat is me  perhaps  it is a little bit sketchy  some sort of impressionist portrait  but it is hardly likely to impress  a man with a hat like that would never be really firm with a sparrow  conflict of wills  and all that  and i bet the sparrow would be the winner  by the way  what   s that stick tied on to it        i believe  sir     said archer     that it is supposed to represent a gun        it is holding it wrong     remarked crane     a man with a hat like that would miss for sure        do you want me to buy another hat     asked the patient archer     no  no     answered his master carelessly     since the poor fellow has such a rotten hat  i   ll give him mine  like the scene of st  martin and the beggar     st  martin                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             give him yours     repeated archer respectfully  but very quietly  the colonel took off his polished top hat and gravely placed it on the head of the oceanic idol at his feet  it had a strange effect of making the grotesque piece of stone look alive  as if a goblin in a top hat was grinning at the garden     do you think the hat shouldn   t be quite new     he asked almost anxiously     not usual among the best scarecrows  perhaps  well  let   s see what we can do to make it a little older     he raised his walking stick above his head and hit the silk hat with a loud smack  smashing it over the empty eyes of the idol     softened with the touch of time now  i think     he remarked  holding out what remained of the silken hat to the gardener     put it on the scarecrow  my friend  i don   t want it  you can be a witness that it   s no use to me     archer obeyed like a robot  a robot with rather round eyes     we must hurry up     said the colonel cheerfully     i was early for church  but i   m afraid i   m a bit late now        did you plan to attend church without a hat  sir     asked the other     certainly not  most disrespectful     said the colonel     nobody should neglect to remove his hat when he enters church  well  if i don   t have a hat  i will neglect to remove it  where is your logic this morning  no  no  just dig up one of your cabbages     once more the well trained servant managed to repeat the word    cabbages    with his own polite intonation  but he couldn   t say it very loudly at the moment     yes  go and pull up a cabbage  please     said the colonel     i must really be going  i believe i heard the clock strike eleven     mr  archer moved heavily in the direction of a plot of cabbages  where many monstrous contours and many colours were open to the eye  objects  perhaps  more worthy of the philosophic eye than is usually taken into account  vegetables are curious looking things and less trivial than they sound  if we called a cabbage a cactus  or some other exotic name  we might see it as an equally exotic thing  the colonel revealed these philosophical truths by dragging a great  green cabbage with its long root out of the earth  before the dubious archer had time to do it  he then picked up a knife and cut short the long tail of the root  after that he cut out the inside leaves to create some empty space  and gravely reversing it  placed it on his head  napoleon and other military princes have crowned themselves  and he  like the caesars  wore a wreath that was  after all  made of green leaves or vegetation  there can be other historical parallels  of course  if the reader is ready to look at such a hat without judgement  the people going to church certainly looked at it  but they did not look at it without judgement  they followed the colonel as he walked almost cheerfully up the road  with feelings that no philosophy could for the moment describe  there seemed to be nothing to be said  except that one of the most respectable and respected of their neighbours  one who might even be called in a quiet way an example of good manners if not a leader of fashion  was walking solemnly up to church with a cabbage on the top of his head  there was indeed no general action to meet the crisis  in their world a crowd could not gather to shout or to attack someone  no rotten eggs could be collected from their tidy breakfast tables  and they were not those people who could throw old cabbage leaves at the cabbage  each of these men lived alone and they could not create an angry crowd  for miles around there were no public houses     public houses   pubs                  and no public opinion  when the colonel approached the church porch and prepared respectfully to remove his vegetarian hat  he was greeted in a tone a little more cheerful than the everyday friendly manners of his neighbours  he responded to the greeting without embarrassment  and paused for a moment when the man who had spoken to him decided to continue speeking  this was a young doctor named horace hunter  tall  handsomely dressed  and confident in manners  though his face was rather ordinary and his hair rather red  he was considered to have a certain charm     good morning  colonel     said the doctor more loudly than usual     what a f    what a fine day it is  stars turned from their courses like comets  so to speak  and the world moved towards wilder variants  at that crucial moment when dr  hunter corrected himself and said     what a fine day     instead of    what a funny hat     the reason why he corrected himself  a true picture of what passed through his mind might sound rather exotic in itself  it would be less than enough to say he did so because of a long grey car waiting outside the colonel   s house  it might not be a complete explanation to say it was because of a lady walking on stilts at a garden party  it might still not be clear  even if we said that it had something to do with a nickname  nevertheless all these things mixed together in the medical gentleman   s mind when he made his decision  above all  it might or might not be sufficient explanation to say that horace hunter was a very ambitious young man  that the ring in his voice and the confidence in his manner came from a very simple resolution to rise in the world  he liked to be seen talking so confidently to colonel crane on that sunday parade  crane was comparatively poor  but he knew people  and people who knew people knew what people were doing now  while people who didn   t know people could only wonder what in the world people would do next  a lady who came with the duchess when she opened the local market had nodded to crane and said     hello  stork     and the doctor had decided that it was a sort of family joke and not a small ornithological mistake  and it was the duchess who had started all that racing on stilts  which the vernon smiths had introduced at their house  but it would have been devilish awkward not to know what mrs  vernon smith meant when she said     of course you stilt     you never knew what they would start next  it was strange to imagine that he would ever begin to see vegetable hats here and there  but you never could tell  his first medical impulse was to add a straitjacket to the colonel   s unusual costume  but crane did not look like a madman  and certainly did not look like a man who was joking  he took it quite naturally  and one thing was certain if it really was the latest fashion thing  the doctor must take it as naturally as the colonel did  so he said it was a fine day  and was very happy to learn that there was no disagreement on that question  the doctor   s dilemma  if we may use the phrase  was the whole neighbourhood   s dilemma  the doctor   s decision was also the whole neighbourhood   s decision  it was not so much that most of the good people there shared hunter   s serious social ambitions  but rather that negative and cautious decisions were natural for them  they did not want other people to bother them about how they lived  and they followed the same principle by not bothering others  they also felt that the polite and respectable military gentleman would not be a very easy person to bother  the result was that the colonel carried his monstrous green hat about the streets of that suburb for nearly a week  and nobody ever mentioned the subject to him  it was about the end of that time  while the doctor had been scanning the horizon for aristocrats crowned with cabbage  and  not seeing any  was collecting his courage to speak  that the final interruption came  and with the interruption the explanation  the colonel looked like he had completely forgotten all about the hat  he took it off and put it on like any other hat  he hung it on the hat peg in his narrow front hall where there was nothing else but his sword and an old brown map of the seventeenth century  he gave it to archer when that loyal man insisted on his official right to hold it  archer did not insist on his official right to brush it  because he was afraid it could fall to pieces  but he occasionally gave it a cautious shake  accompanied by a look of restrained dislike  but the colonel himself never showed any signs of either liking or disliking it  the unconventional thing had already become one of his conventions     the conventions which he never thought about enough to break  so it is probable that what at last happened was as much of a surprise to him as to anybody  anyway  the explanation  or explosion  came in the following way  mr  vernon smith was a small  neat gentleman with a big nose  dark moustache  and dark eyes with a constant expression of anxiety  though nobody knew what he was so anxious about in his very solid social life  he was a friend of dr  hunter  you could almost say a humble friend  he had the negative snobbishness that could only admire the positive and progressive snobbishness of that social figure  a man like dr  hunter likes to have a man like mr  smith  because he can pose as a perfect man of the world before him  what is more extraordinary is that a man like mr  smith really likes to have a man like dr  hunter to pose and to show his superiority  anyhow  at one moment vernon smith decided to hint that the new hat of his neighbour crane did not look like it was from a fashion magazine  and dr  hunter  bursting with his secrets  called this idea stupid and made jokes about it  with calculated  confident gestures  with large phrases full of allusions  he left on his friend   s mind the impression that the whole social world would be destroyed  if anyone said a word on such a delicate topic  mr  vernon smith formed a general idea that the colonel would explode with a loud bang at the slightest hint on vegetables  or any word which sounded just a little bit like    hat     as usually happens in such cases  the words he was forbidden to say repeated themselves constantly in his mind with the rhythm of his pulse  at the moment he wanted to call all houses hats and all visitors vegetables  when crane came out of his front gate that morning he found his neighbour vernon smith standing outside  between a tree and a lamp post  talking to a young lady  a distant cousin of his family  this girl was an art student     a little too independent for the standards of this neighbourhood  her brown hair was cut very short  and the colonel did not admire short haircuts  on the other hand  she had a rather attractive face  with honest brown eyes a little too wide apart  which diminished the impression of beauty but increased the impression of honesty  she also had a very fresh and natural voice  and the colonel had often heard it calling out scores at tennis on the other side of the garden wall  in some way it made him feel old  at least  he was not sure whether he felt older than he was  or younger than he was supposed to be  it was not until they met under the lamp post that he knew her name was audrey smith  and he was thankful for the simple short name  mr  vernon smith presented her  and very nearly said    may i introduce my cabbage     instead of    my cousin     the colonel  without a change in his intonation  said it was a fine day  and his neighbour  happy to escape from a very difficult situation  continued the conversation cheerfully  his manner  like when he came to local meetings and committees  was at once hesitating and confident     this young lady is going into art     he said     a poor prospect  isn   t it  i expect we will see her drawing in chalk on the pavement and expecting us to throw a penny into the     into a tray  or something     here he escaped from another danger     but of course  she thinks she   s going to be a royal academician     royal academician                                                                                                                                     i hope not     said the young woman hotly     pavement artists are much more honest than most of the royal academicians        i wish those friends of yours didn   t give you such revolutionary ideas     said mr  vernon smith     my cousin knows the most dreadful eccentrics  vegetarians and     mad socialists     he decided to say it  feeling that vegetarians were not quite the same as vegetables  and he felt sure the colonel would share his horror of socialists     people who want to be equal  and all that  what i say is     we   re not equal and we never can be  as i always say to audrey     if all the property were divided tomorrow  it would go back into the same hands the next day  it   s a law of nature  and if a man thinks he can get round a law of nature  why  he   s talking through his     i mean  he   s as mad as a         trying to escape from the image in his head  he was searching madly in his mind for the alternative of a march hare                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   to talk through one   s hat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            as mad as a hatter                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           as mad as a march hare                                                                                                                                                        but before he could find it  the girl had cut in and completed his sentence  she smiled calmly  and said in her clear and ringing tones     as mad as colonel crane   s hatter     it is not unjust to mr  vernon smith to say that he ran as from a dynamite explosion  it would be unjust to say that he left a lady in distress  because she did not look in the least like a distressed lady  and he himself was a very distressed gentleman  he tried to ask her to go indoors  and then vanished there himself with a random apology  but the other two took no notice of him  they continued to confront each other  and both were smiling     i think you must be the bravest man in england     she said     i don   t mean anything about the war  or your medal and all that  i mean about this  oh  yes  i know a little about this  but there   s one thing i don   t know  why do you do it        i think it is you who are the bravest woman in england     he answered     or  at any rate  the bravest person in these parts  i   ve walked about this town for a week  feeling like the last fool on earth  and expecting somebody to say something  and not a soul has said a word  they all seem to be afraid of saying the wrong thing        i think they   re deadly     said miss smith     and if they don   t have cabbages for hats  it   s only because they have turnips for heads        no     said the colonel gently     i have many generous and friendly neighbours here  including your cousin  believe me  there is a reason why people have conventions  and the world is wiser than you know  you are too young not to be intolerant  but i can see you   ve got the fighting spirit  that is the best part of youth and intolerance        you see  i can   t keep calm when they say all these polished vulgarities about everything     look at what he said about socialism     answered the girl     it was a little superficial     said crane with a smile     and that     she concluded     is why i admire your hat  though i don   t know why you wear it     this trivial conversation had a curious effect on the colonel  there went with it a sort of warmth and a sense of crisis that he had not known since the war  a sudden purpose formed itself in his mind  and he spoke like one stepping across a border     miss smith     he said     i wonder if i might ask you to pay me a bigger compliment  it may be unconventional  but i believe you do not insist on these conventions  an old friend of mine will be visiting me shortly  to finish the rather unusual business or ceremonial of which by chance you have seen a part  if you would do me the honour to have lunch with me tomorrow at half past one  the true story of the cabbage awaits you  i promise that you will hear the real reason  i might even say i promise you will see the real reason        oh  of course i will     said the unconventional one cheerfully     thanks awfully     the colonel took an intense interest in the preparations for lunch next day  with surprise he found himself not only interested  but excited  like many of his type  he took a pleasure in doing such things well  and knew his way about in wine and cookery  but that would not alone explain his pleasure  because he knew that young women generally know very little about wine  and emancipated young women probably least of all  and though he wanted the cookery to be good  he knew that one part of it would appear rather fantastic  again  he was a good natured gentleman who wanted young people to enjoy a lunch party  as he would have wanted a child to enjoy a christmas tree  but there seemed no reason why he should have a sort of happy insomnia  like a child on christmas eve     christmas eve                                                                                                                                                        there was really no excuse for his walking up and down the garden with his cigar  smoking furiously almost till the morning  because while he looked at the purple irises and the grey pool in the moonshine  something in his feelings moved as if from the one end to the other  he had a new and unexpected reaction  for the first time he really hated the masquerade he had put himself through  he wished he could smash the cabbage as he had smashed the top hat  he was little more than forty years old  but he suddenly felt the monstrous and solemn vanity of a young man growing inside him  sometimes he looked up at house next door  dark against the moonrise  and thought he heard quiet voices in it  and something like a laugh  the visitor who came to the colonel next morning may have been an old friend  but he certainly had a very different personality  he was a very absent minded  rather untidy man in a shabby suit  he had a long head with straight hair of the dark red colour  one or two bits of which stood on end however he brushed it  his face was long and clean shaven and a little fuller around the jaw and chin  which he usually put down and settled firmly into his cravat  his name was hood  and he was a lawyer  though he had not come to the colonel on strictly legal business  anyhow  he exchanged greetings with crane with a quiet warmth and satisfaction  smiled at the old servant as if he were an old joke  and showed every sign of an appetite for his lunch  the appointed day was unusually warm and bright  and everything in the garden seemed to glitter  the goblin god of the oceania seemed really to grin  and the scarecrow really to have a new hat  the irises round the pool were swinging and flapping in a light wind  and he remembered they were called    flags    and thought of purple banners going into battle  she had come suddenly round the corner of the house  her dress was of a dark but fresh blue colour  of a very simple form  but not too artistic  and in the morning light she looked less like a schoolgirl and more like a serious woman of twenty five or thirty  a   little older and a great deal more interesting  and something in this morning seriousness increased the reaction of the night before  one single wave of relief went through crane to think that at least his terrible green hat was gone and finished with for ever  he had worn it for a week without caring one bit for anybody   s opinion  but during that ten minutes    trivial conversation under the lamp post  he felt as if he had suddenly grown donkey   s ears in the street  because of the sunny weather he prepared a little table for three in a sort of veranda open to the garden  when the three sat down to it  he looked across at the lady and said     i fear i   m going to look like an eccentric  one of those eccentrics your cousin disapproves of  miss smith  i hope it won   t spoil this little lunch for anybody  but i am going to have a vegetarian meal        are you     she said     i would never have said you looked like a vegetarian        just lately i have only looked like a fool     he said calmly     but i think i   d sooner look a fool than a vegetarian in the ordinary way  this is rather a special occasion  perhaps my friend hood had better begin  it   s really his story more than mine        my name is robert owen hood     said that gentleman  rather sarcastically     that   s how improbable memories often begin  but the only point now is that my old friend here insulted me horribly by calling me robin hood        i would have called it a compliment     answered audrey smith     buy why did he call you robin hood        because i used the long bow     because i used the long bow                                long bow                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 said the lawyer     but to do you justice     said the colonel     it seems that you hit the bull   s eye      to hit the bull   s eye                                                                                                                                                                                                                         while he spoke archer came in with a dish which he placed before his master  he had already served the others with the earlier meals  but he carried this one with the pomp of one bringing the boar   s head at christmas      the boar   s head                                                                                                                                                                                        it consisted of a plain boiled cabbage     i was challenged to do something     continued hood     which my friend here declared to be impossible  in fact  any sane man would have declared it to be impossible  but i did it all the same  only my friend  in the heat of rejecting and mocking the idea  used an expression he didn   t think about  i might almost say he made a rash vow      made a rash vow                                                                 my exact words were     said colonel crane solemnly        if you can do that  i   ll eat my hat        he leaned forward thoughtfully and began to eat it  then he continued in the same meditative way     you see  all rash vows are literal or nothing  there might be a debate about the logical and literary way in which my friend hood fulfilled his rash vow  but i accepted it as a challenge in the same pedantic sort of way  it wasn   t possible to eat any hat that i wore  but it could be possible to wear a hat that i could eat  parts of dress could hardly be used for diet  but parts of diet could really be used for dress  it seemed to me that it could become my hat  if i wore it systematically as a hat and had no other  putting up with all the disadvantages  making a fool of myself was the fair price to be paid for the vow or bet  because you should always lose something on a bet     and he rose from the table with a gesture of apology  the girl stood up     i think it   s perfectly splendid     she said     it   s as wild as one of those stories about looking for the holy grail       holy grail                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    the lawyer also had risen  rather quickly  and stood touching his long chin with his thumb and looking at his old friend under bent brows in a rather meditative manner     well  you   ve made me a witness all right     he said     and now  with the permission of the court  i   ll leave the witness box  i   m afraid i must be going  i   ve got important business at home  good bye  miss smith     the girl answered a little mechanically  and crane seemed to recover from a similar trance  when he stepped after the retreating figure of his friend     i say  owen     he said quickly     i   m sorry you   re leaving so early  do you really have to go        yes     replied owen hood gravely     my private affairs are quite real and practical  i assure you     his grave mouth showed some signs of a smile at the corners when he added    the truth is  i don   t think i mentioned it  but i   m thinking of getting married        married     repeated the colonel  as if struck by a lightning     thanks for your compliments and congratulations  old fellow     said the satiric mr  hood     yes  it   s all been thought through  i   ve even decided who i am going to marry  she knows about it herself  she has been warned        i am really sorry     said the colonel in great distress     of course i congratulate you from my heart  and her even more so  of course i   m very happy to hear it  the truth is  i was surprised    not so much in that way          not so much in what way     asked hood     i suppose you mean some would say i was on the way to be an old bachelor  but i   ve discovered it isn   t half so much a question of years as of habits  men like me get elderly more by choice than chance  and there   s much more choice and less chance in life than your modern fatalists believe  for such people fatalism changes even chronology  they   re not unmarried because they   re old  they   re old because they   re unmarried        indeed you are mistaken     said crane earnestly     as i say  i was surprised  but my surprise was not as rude as you think  it wasn   t that i thought there was anything wrong about    somehow it was rather the other way    as if things could fit better than one thought    as if     but anyhow  as little as i know about it  i really do congratulate you        i   ll tell you all about it before long     replied his friend     it   s enough to say just now that it was all connected with my succeeding after all in doing     what i did  she was the inspiration  you know  i have done what is called an impossible thing  but believe me  she is really the impossible part of it        well  i must not keep you from such an impossible engagement     said crane smiling     really  i   m awfully glad to hear about all this  well  good bye for now     colonel crane stood watching the square shoulders and dark red hair of his old friend  when they disappeared down the road  in a rather indescribable state of mind  when he turned quickly back towards his garden and his other guest  he noticed something had changed  things seemed different in some light headed and illogical manner  he could not himself understand what had happened  indeed  he did not know whether it happened inside or outside  he was very far from being a fool  but his brains were of the sort that are directed outwards to things  the brains of the soldier or the scientific man  and he had no practice in analysing his own mind  he did not quite understand why the news about owen hood should give him that strange sense of a difference in things in general  without a doubt  he was very fond of owen hood  but he had been fond of other people who had got married without especially disturbing the atmosphere of his own back garden  he even thought that his feelings on their own might have worked the other way  that they might have made him worry about hood  and wonder whether hood was making a fool of himself  or even feel suspicious or jealous of mrs  hood     something else made him feel quite the other way  he could not quite understand it  there seemed to be an increasing number of things that he could not understand  this world in which he himself wore pieces of green cabbage and in which his old friend the lawyer got married suddenly like a man going mad     this world was a new world  at once fresh and frightening  in which he could hardly understand the figures that were walking about  even his own  the flowers in the flower beds looked differently  at once bright and nameless  and even the line of vegetables beyond could not altogether depress him with the memories of his last escapade  indeed he felt very much like someone in the morning of the world  but beyond that he could understand nothing  audrey smith was standing not so very many yards away  because he had followed his elder guest for only a few steps towards the gate  yet her figure had fallen back far enough to be surrounded by the green framework of the garden  her dress looked almost blue with a shade of distance  and when she spoke to him  even from that little way off  her voice sounded to him like the voice of someone shouting familiarly and from afar  like you call to an old friend  it made him emotional in a disproportionate way  though all that she said was     what became of your old hat        i lost it     he answered gravely     obviously i had to lose it  i believe the scarecrow found it        oh  let   s go and look at the scarecrow  please     she cried  he led her without a word to the kitchen garden and gravely explained each of its outstanding features  from the serious mr  archer resting on his spade to the grotesque oceanic island god grinning at the corner of the plot  he spoke more and more solemnly and used too many words  and all the time knew little or nothing of what he said
